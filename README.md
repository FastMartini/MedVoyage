# MedVoyage


# Inspiration

learning about discrete structures and decision algorithms had sparked an interest in exploring Medvoyage.

# What it does

Medvoyage is an innovative and user-friendly website designed to provide quick and accurate medical diagnoses. At the heart of Medvoyage's diagnostic system is a powerful binary tree algorithm. Medvoyage boasts a user-friendly and intuitive interface that makes the diagnostic process accessible to individuals of all technological backgrounds.

# How we built it

In the realm of frontend development, Diego and Khalil played pivotal roles. Diego took charge of crafting the website's frontend design. Employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, he meticulously designed the visual aspects of Medvoyage. This encompassed tasks such as defining the layout, selecting color schemes, choosing typography, and crafting the overall user interface to make Medvoyage not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and intuitive.

Khalil, on the other hand, was entrusted with the crucial task of building the functional core of Medvoyage's frontend. He undertook the implementation of the binary tree algorithm using JavaScript. This algorithm forms the backbone of the diagnostic process on Medvoyage, guiding users through a series of questions and decisions to arrive at a preliminary medical diagnosis. Khalil's work was instrumental in ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of the platform's diagnostic capabilities.

Meanwhile, the backend of Medvoyage was expertly crafted by Matthew and Chris. Matthew took the lead in setting up the backend infrastructure, including the server and databases. His responsibilities included optimizing data storage and retrieval processes, ensuring that Medvoyage could efficiently handle the extensive database of medical information underpinning the platform.

Chris, working alongside Matthew, concentrated on the server-side functionality. He integrated security measures to safeguard user data and privacy, implemented robust concurrent user request handling, and facilitated the seamless connection between the frontend and backend systems, ensuring that Medvoyage operated reliably.

# Challenges we ran into

Crafting a robust and precise algorithm that could effectively navigate through the multitude of symptoms, conditions, and medical information in real-time had been a formidable task for us

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

- implementing the Parallax design of the website had been a huge accomplishment as     it was the first time we've ever done that

- successfully creating a binary tree that had served its purpose

# What we learned

- how to create parallax scrolling

- how to create a binary tree
  What's next for MedVoyage

- add accessibility for different screen sizes

- add an extensive database of diseases and health conditions to our algorithm

- add an about page and contacts page
